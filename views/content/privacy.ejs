    <h2>General information</h2>
    <p>Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the data protection regulations of the Swiss
        Confederation (Data Protection Act, DSG ), every person has a right of protection of their privacy as well as
        protection against misuse of their personal data. The operators of these pages take the protection of your
        personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentiality and in accordance with the legal data
        protection regulations as well as the privacy policy.</p>
    <p>In cooperation with our hosting providers, we make every effort to protect the databases as well as possible
        against unauthorized access, loss, misuse or falsification.</p>
    <p>We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have
        security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
    <p>By using this website, you consent to the collection, processing and use of data in accordance with the following
        description. This website can generally be visited without registration. Data such as pages accessed or names of
        files accessed, date and time are stored on the server for statistical purposes without the data being directly
        related to your person. Personal data, in particular name, address or e-mail address are collected as far as
        possible on a voluntary basis. No data will be passed on to third parties without your consent.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Processing of personal data</h2>
    <p>Personal data is any information that relates to a specific or identifiable person. A data subject is a person
        about whom personal data is processed. Processing includes any handling of personal data, regardless of the
        means and procedures used, in particular the storage, disclosure, acquisition, deletion, storage, modification,
        destruction and use of personal data.</p>
    <p>We process personal data in accordance with Swiss data protection law. Furthermore, to the extent and insofar as
        the EU GDPR is applicable, we process personal data in accordance with the following legal bases in connection
        with Art. 6 (1) GDPR:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>lit. a) Processing of personal data with the consent of the data subject.</li>
        <li>lit. b) Processing of personal data for the fulfillment of a contract with the data subject </li>
        <li>lit. c) Processing of personal data for the fulfillment of a legal obligation to which we are subject under
            any applicable law of the EU or under any applicable law of a country in which the GDPR is applicable in
            whole or in part.</li>
        <li>lit. d) Processing of personal data in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another
            natural person.</li>
        <li>lit. f) Processing of personal data to protect the legitimate interests of us or of third parties, unless
            the fundamental freedoms and rights and interests of the data subject are overridden. Legitimate interests
            include, in particular, our business interest in being able to provide our website, information security,
            the enforcement of our own legal claims and compliance with Swiss law.</li>
        <p>We process personal data for the duration required for the respective purpose or purposes. In the case of
            longer-term retention obligations due to legal and other obligations to which we are subject, we restrict
            processing accordingly.</p>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Privacy policy for SSL/TLS encryption</h2>
    <p>This website uses SSL/TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
        content, such as the inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted
        connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the
        lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
    <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Privacy policy for server log files</h2>
    <p>The provider of this website automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files,
        which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>browser type and browser version</li>
        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>referrer URL</li>
        <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
        <li>Time of the server request</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data cannot be assigned to specific persons and is not merged with other data sources. We reserve the
        right to check the data retrospectively if we become aware of specific indications of illegal use.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Data protection declaration for contact form</h2>
    <p>If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your data from the inquiry form, including the contact data
        you provided there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up
        questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Data protection declaration for objection advertising mails</h2>
    <p>We hereby object to the use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation to send
        advertising and information material that has not been expressly requested. The operators of the pages
        expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising
        information, such as spam e-mails.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Privacy policy for Twitter</h2>
    <p>This website uses functions of Twitter, Inc, 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. When
        you call up our pages with Twitter plug-ins, a connection is established between your browser and the
        servers of Twitter. In the process, data is already transferred to Twitter. If you have a Twitter account,
        this data can be linked to it. If you do not want this data to be associated with your Twitter account,
        please log out of Twitter before visiting our site. Interactions, in particular clicking on a "re-tweet"
        button, are also passed on to Twitter. To learn more, please visit https://twitter.com/privacy.</a>.

    <h2>General disclaimer</h2>
    <p>All information on our website has been carefully checked. We make every effort to ensure that the
        information we provide is up-to-date, correct and complete. Nevertheless, the occurrence of errors cannot be
        completely excluded, which means that we cannot guarantee the completeness, accuracy and timeliness of
        information, including journalistic and editorial. Liability claims regarding damage caused by the use of
        any information provided, including any kind of information which is incomplete or incorrect, will therefore
        be rejected.</p>
    <p>The publisher may change or delete texts at his own discretion and without notice and is not obliged to
        update the contents of this website. The use of or access to this website is at the visitor's own risk. The
        publisher, its clients or partners are not responsible for damages, such as direct, indirect, incidental,
        consequential or punitive damages, allegedly caused by the visit of this website and consequently assume no
        liability for such damages.</p>
    <p>The publisher also accepts no responsibility or liability for the content and availability of third-party
        websites that can be accessed via external links on this website. The operators of the linked sites are
        solely responsible for their content. The publisher thus expressly distances itself from all third-party
        content that may be relevant under criminal or liability law or that may be contrary to public morality.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We can adapt the data protection declaration at any time without prior notice. The current version published
        on our website shall apply. Insofar as the data protection declaration is part of an agreement with you, we
        will inform you of the change by e-mail or other suitable means in the event of an update.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Questions to the data protection officer</h2>
